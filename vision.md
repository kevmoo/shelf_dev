# Example structure

- `example` directory
  - `web_app` has Flutter web app
  - `web_api` has `package:shelf` service.
  - `firebase` config file - TBD - can we commit it?
  - `shelf-dev.yaml` configuration file specifying how local hosting works.
  - Easy setup to run locally.
  - Easy setup to deploy both the web app to firebase hosting and to deploy the
    service + Dockerfile to cloud run
  - some way to wire them all together
